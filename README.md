# PHP Mastery Project

This project aims to implement advanced PHP 8 concepts, exploring OOP and modern design patterns. Each feature developed throughout the project reflects the lessons learned from the book PHP 8: Objects, Patterns, and Practice, with continuous improvements, refactoring, and the application of best development practices.

Here, experiments and hands-on projects form the foundation for mastering PHP code architecture, using best practices for code organization, scalability, and efficiency.

### Exploring OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

The first part of the project focuses on understanding and applying fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, with an emphasis on good practices in using classes, attributes, and methods.

### Visibility of Attributes and Methods

It's crucial to define the appropriate visibility for class attributes and methods:

    private attributes and methods: Can only be accessed within the class itself.
    public attributes and methods: Can be accessed from outside the class, allowing interaction with the class instance.

### Best Practices in OOP Usage

Correct use of visibility and encapsulation ensures the integrity and security of class data, making the code more maintainable and scalable.
