# PHP Mastery Project

This project aims to implement advanced PHP 8 concepts, exploring OOP and modern design patterns. Each feature developed throughout the project reflects the lessons learned from the book PHP 8: Objects, Patterns, and Practice, with continuous improvements, refactoring, and the application of best development practices.

Here, experiments and hands-on projects form the foundation for mastering PHP code architecture, using best practices for code organization, scalability, and efficiency.
